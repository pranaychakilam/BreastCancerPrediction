# BreastCancerPrediction
Aim of this project is to detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.

Built a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).
Clump thickness
Uniformity of cell size
Uniformity of cell shape
Marginal adhesion
Single epithelial cell
Bare Nuclei
Bland chromatin
Normal nucleoli
Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making.
Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
