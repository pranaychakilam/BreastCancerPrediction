# BreastCancerPrediction
Aim of this project is to detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.

Built a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).
(i)Clump thickness
ii.Uniformity of cell size
iii.Uniformity of cell shape
iv.Marginal adhesion
v.Single epithelial cell
vi.Bare Nuclei
vii.Bland chromatin
viii.Normal nucleoli
ix.Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making.
Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
